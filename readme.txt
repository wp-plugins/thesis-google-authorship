Adds Google Authorship support to the Thesis theme.

== Description ==

After setting this up on several sites, I figured it may be time to release this simple plugin into the wild. This plugin adds google authorship support to the Thesis theme. It creates a new contact method called "Google Profile URL" to the WordPress profiles screen, adds a rel=me to the author byline, and adds a link to the Google+ profile on the author's archive with rel=author. If you can't do domain email verification to establish authorship and you're using Thesis, this plugin will help.

Should work with Thesis 1.6+. Please let me know if there are any issues. 

1. Make sure you have “Show author name in post byline” and “Link author name to archive” selected under Thesis Design Options &gt; Display Options &gt; Bylines.
1. Add your Google+ profile link to your profile information.
1. Add a link to your author archive to your Google+ profile, in either your "other profiles" or "contributor to" sections.
1. Check everything by visiting the <a href="http://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/richsnippets">Google Rich Snippets testing Tool</a>.

== Installation ==

1. Upload file to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

Alternatively:
1. Search for "Thesis Google Authorship" in the Plugins->Add New dashboard
